    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>American goulash is an easy and delicious one-pot dinner that can be made in under an hour if you have better time management than I do.  If you're like me and like to add too much water and get too lazy to strain it out than it'll take approximately an hour and 20 minutes.  I sure do love this shit!  Though it actually has very little resemblance to the Hungarian dish of it's namesake, I don't give a shit about that, and this is a modified recipe from my mommy :&#41</p>
        <p>Actually, so I don't have to do a bunch of content writing outside of this introduction, the recipe will be based on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/275489/chef-johns-american-goulash/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer> one from Allrecipes</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong> pounds ground beef</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>large onion, diced</li>
        <li><strong>4 </strong>cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>large bay leaves</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>teaspoons italian seasoning</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>teaspoons salt</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 </strong>teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong> pinch cayenne</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>quart water or chicken broth</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>cup water</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>2 </strong>cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 </strong>cup chopped italian parsley</li>
        <li><strong>1 </strong>cup shredded cheddar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>1. </strong>Gather Ingredients</li>
        <li><strong>2. </strong>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, <em>3 to 5 minutes</em>. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</li>
        <li><strong>3. </strong>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, <em>about 30 minutes.</em></li>
        <li><strong>4. </strong>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after <em>10 minutes.</em></li>
        <li><strong>5. </strong>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for <em>5 minutes.</em> Taste and season as desired.</li>
    </ol>
