    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Chicken alfredo</strong> baybeee, it's fuckin good!</p>
        <p>Chicken alfredo is, in fact, so good, that I went through the trouble of stealing <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11970/easy-chicken-alfredo/" target="_blank" noopener noreferrer>this recipe</a> from allrecipes for this project, though I've never actually cooked this particular recipe.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pound uncoocked fetuccine or linguine</li>
        <li>2 boneless chicken breast halves, cooked and cubed</li>
        <li>1 jar Alfredo-style pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 package mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1 can sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, place cubed cooked chicken, Alfredo sauce, frozen vegetables, mushrooms, and milk in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir until chicken is heated through and vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Serve warm Alfredo and chicken sauce over cooked noodles.</li>
    </ul>
